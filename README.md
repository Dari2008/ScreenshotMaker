Here’s a concise Markdown version combining a **short description** and **how to run** the JAR:

---

# ScreenshotMaker

**ScreenshotMaker** is a lightweight application for quickly capturing full-screen or custom-region screenshots using global keyboard shortcuts. Images are saved automatically for easy access and sharing.

---

## How to Run

Make sure **Java 8+** is installed. Open a terminal in the folder containing `ScreenshotMaker.jar` and run:

```bash
java -jar ScreenshotMaker.jar
```

Once running, use the default shortcuts:

* `Ctrl + Shift + S` → Take a screenshot
* `Ctrl + R` → Retake a screenshot

This is short, clear, and beginner-friendly.

If you want, I can make an **even shorter one-liner version** suitable for an app store or README.
